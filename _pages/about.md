I'm a Ph.D. candidate in physics at the University of Rochester under the guidance of [Prof. Robert W. Boyd](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/optics/people/faculty/boyd_robert/index.html). My research focuses on ultrafast nonlinear optics, quantum imaging, and quantum frequency conversion. Most of my research work aims to extend our application of the nonlinear optical processes of common and exotic nonlinear materials. Currently, I am interested in exploring exciting new applications of the large sub-picosecond-level nonlinear optical response from epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. On the quantum side, I have been deeply involved in many theoretical and experimental works on quantum-enhanced imaging and microscopy schemes. 

Prior to my Ph.D. study, I obtained my bachelor's degree in physics my with Magna Cum Laude from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in 2019.

Recent News and Events
------
May 8, 2025 -- I will be giving a talk on my recent progress of the ENZ-based time gating at CLEO 2025 Long Beach. Check out the schedule and come to 103 B at 4 PM! 

April 14, 2025 -- My REU mentee, Alex Mavian from RPI, will be attending Yale for his graduate studies. My post-bac mentee, Jiaqi Wang, will join the PhD program at CREOL this year. Congratulations to both of them!

April 7, 2025 -- My work with Cisco on scalable reconfigurable quantum networks is now online on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05567)!

March 27, 2025 -- My work on ENZ-based time-gate is now online on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21113). We made an ultrafast time gate on ITO that improved the scattering rejection effect by two orders of magnitude!

Jan 13, 2025 -- My work on fast quantum ghost imaging with my REU student, Alex Mavian, is published in [Optics Letters](https://opg.optica.org/ol/fulltext.cfm?uri=ol-50-2-594&id=566940).
