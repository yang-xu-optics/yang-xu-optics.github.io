About Me
------
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in physics at the University of Rochester under the guidance of [Prof. Robert W. Boyd](https://www.hajim.rochester.edu/optics/people/faculty/boyd_robert/index.html). My research focuses on ultrafast nonlinear optics, quantum imaging, and quantum frequency conversion. Most of my research work aims to extend our application of the nonlinear optical processes of common and exotic nonlinear materials. Currently, I am interested in exploring exciting new applications of the large sub-picosecond-level nonlinear optical response from epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials. On the quantum side, I have been deeply involved in many theoretical and experimental works on quantum-enhanced imaging and microscopy schemes. 

Prior to my Ph.D. study, I obtained my bachelor's degree in physics my with Magna Cum Laude from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) in 2019.

Recent News and Events
------
May 8, 2025 -- I will be giving a talk on my recent progress of the ENZ-based time gating at CLEO 2025 Long Beach. Check out the schedule and come to 103 B at 4 PM! 

April 14, 2025 -- My REU mentee, Alex Mavian from RPI, will be attending Yale for his graduate studies. My post-bac mentee, Jiaqi Wang, will join the PhD program at CREOL this year. Congratulations to both of them!

April 7, 2025 -- My work with Cisco on scalable reconfigurable quantum networks is now online on arXiv!

March 27, 2025 -- My work on ENZ-based time-gate is now online on arXiv. We made an ultrafast time gate on ITO that improved the scattering rejection effect by two orders of magnitude!

Jan 13, 2025 -- The work on fast quantum ghost imaging with my REU student, Alex Mavian, is published in Optics Letters. 




Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
